### Individual reflection

In the individual reflection, please address the following questions, using the A, B, A -> B reflective loop as described above:

- what do I want to learn or understand better?
	I want to learn more about the process of Scrum, and understand how effective it may be in other companies. In this project we will be working on Android application, so I would like to learn about how to use Android Studio, and learn more about programming in Kotlin or Java.
- how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	If teammates needs help, I could give them a starting point of what they should do to continue their working process, or simply by working with them together.
- what is my contribution towards the team’s application of Scrum?
	At first week have I learned just a bit of how Scrum work. But haven't experienced it yet in the real project yet. But I could remind the team the way of working in Scrum, in order to manage the project.
- what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	I would work and help on anything just in order to make the process of this project more effective.

That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
