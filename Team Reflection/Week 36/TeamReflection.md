# Team reflection

As a team you should reflect on the following topics:

# Customer Value and Scope
### *The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value*  
We chose a pessimistic scope of the application, meaning low velocity and realistic workload, to deliver the expected value to the Product Owner. This was to reduce the amount of technical dept which may remain between each sprint, but also to be able to bring quality to the prioritized features of the application.
### *The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application*  
We wanted to prioritize quality over quantity which led to a high effort estimation. We wanted to create a product that the product owner was satisfied with. If we had any questions regarding the acceptance criteria we make sure to ask it before the deadline.
### *Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation*  
We solved each user story by splitting us in groups of three. Two people built the actual lego piece. Two people collected legos, either from the box of legos or from other groups through negotiation. Finally, one person was assigned the role of being the scrum master. He talked with the product owner to ensure that the end result would match the acceptance criteria. Our effort estimation was quite high, we assumed that a lego bus would take an entire sprint to build, which ended up being an accurate estimation.
### *Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom*  
The product owner confirmed if the lego piece looked as expected.
### *The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them*  
We only used one KPI for the Lego exercise, and that was the amount of remarks the product owner had on our product. The less remarks, the better. This was a bad decision because we could not know the current KPI, only after the current sprint. Next time, we will use more KPIs.

# Social Contract and Effort
### *Your socialcontract, i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team (this means, of course, you should create one in the first week)*
We expect all the team members to work on the task that they have been assigned with no complaining. They should also help other team members whenever necessary and be able to receive constructive criticism. Every individual is expected to ask for help as soon as they need it and avoid dragging it out.
### *The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)*
Approximately 11 hours in total, with 6 hours being lectures, 4 hours exercise and 1 hour team reflection.

# Design decisions and product structure
### *How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value*
The decisions were based on agreements of discussion solely regarding the user stories. We made few attempts of contacting the customer before making a decision of design.
### *What you document and why, by using e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents etc.*
For the exercise this first week of the course, we had no use for documentation. When the project starts we will, for instance, need to document any changes we make to be able to keep track of what we do and why.
### *How you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints*
The documentation will be used and updated through Github each sprint.
### *How you ensure code quality, enforce coding standards*
To ensure code quality weâ€™ll use short gaps between each testing of the written code. Every upload of code to Github must be formatted according to Google-Java-Format.

# Application of Scrum
### *The roles you have used within the team*
We had one scrum master, and the rest were scrum members. Scrum master had the responsibility to talk with other scrum masters to decide who will do what in each sprint, and inform the scrum members.
### *The agile practices you have used for the current sprint*
Product backlog, sprint backlog, sprint, sprint review, sprint retrospective, sprint planning.
### *The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)*
The product owner told us if we achieved the acceptance criteria or not, and if he was happy with the product design or not. By that we could plan for the next sprint about what we need to change.
### *Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)*
If a team member is unfamiliar with the new technology, it's up to that member to get a basic understanding about it. Maybe watch some videos on youtube, read documentation or just simply ask for help.
### *Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)*
The team can develop a better understanding of applying scrum to a project by reading literature and attending lectures, which in turn develops our reflections.
