### Team reflection

As a team you should reflect on the following topics:

*Customer Value and Scope*
- the chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
- the success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application
- your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
- your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom
- the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them

*Social Contract and Effort*
- your [social contract][socialcontract], i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team (this means, of course, you should create one in the first week)
- the time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)

*Design decisions and product structure*
- how your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value
- what you document and why, by using e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents etc.
- how you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints
- how you ensure code quality, enforce coding standards, and

*Application of Scrum*
- the roles you have used within the team
- the agile practices you have used for the current sprint
- the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)
- best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)
- relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)
